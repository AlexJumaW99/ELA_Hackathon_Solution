    '''
    How Does Ammonia Affect Water Quality? Ammonia in drinking water can sometimes create an
    unpleasant taste and smell, which is caused by the formation of chloramines, which the addition of ammonia helps promote.
    Chloramines form when both chlorine and ammonia are added to drinking water to disinfect it.
    '''
    ,
    '''
    Why is dissolved oxygen important for water quality?
    Dissolved oxygen is the amount of gaseous oxygen dissolved in the water.
    Oxygen gets into the water in various ways, including absorbing it from the atmosphere,
    by rapid movement of the water, or as a product of photosynthesis. Oxygen is what gives the water life!
    Fish and plants depend on certain levels of oxygen to survive.
    '''
    ,
    '''
    E. coli in water is a strong indicator of sewage or animal waste contamination.
    Sewage and animal waste can contain many types of disease causing organisms.
    Consumption may result in severe illness; children under five years of age,
    those with compromised immune systems, and the elderly are particularly susceptible.
    '''
    ,
    '''
    Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for plants and animals.
    However, excessive phosphorus in surface water can cause explosive growth of aquatic plants and algae.
    This can lead to a variety of water-quality problems, including low dissolved oxygen concentrations,
    which can cause fish kills and harm other aquatic life.
    '''
    ,
    '''
    Why is water temperature important? Water temperature is a key feature of any water body.
    It changes the water‚Äôs density, the water‚Äôs ability to support life, as well as its ability to absorb gases (like CO‚ÇÇ), and nutrients.
    Increases in water temperature can cause some chemicals to become ‚Äúsoluble‚Äù:
    think how quickly salt dissolves in hot water versus cold water.
    Algae blooms and other vegetation can also grow more quickly in warmer water.
    When these blooms decompose, they reduce the total amount of dissolved oxygen in the water,
    making it difficult for fish and other aquatic critters to breath.
    '''
    ,
    '''
    Why is pH important for water quality? 
    pH stands for ‚Äúpotential for Hydrogen‚Äù. It is the measure of the acidity or alkalinity of water soluble substances.
    pH sets up the conditions for how easy it is for nutrients to be available and how easily things like heavy metals (toxicity for aquatic life) can dissolve in the water.
    Rivers and lakes generally range between 5 (acidic) and 9 (basic) on the pH scale.
    Whereas ocean water averages closer to 8.2 (slightly basic).
    Low pH can reduce how many fish eggs hatch and can make life difficult for fish and macroinvertebrates (the backbone of our water ecosystems).

    Ammonia is analyzed by chemical titration.
    The method used in most test kits is called the salicylate method.
    Always measure pH and temperature when you measure ammonia.
    '''
    ,
    '''
    Dissolved oxygen is measured as a concentration, in units of milligrams per litre (mg/L).
    We use the Chemetrics dissolved oxygen testkit because it is the most user friendly to conduct
    (no measuring chemicals) and easier to interpret than other tests we have tried.
    This device has been compared to professional probes with very good results.
    Full study by Carleton University to compare our kits to professional probes. 
    The inexpensive probes that we have tried were finicky and inaccurate (even with proper calibration).
    Professional probes will give you more fine-grain results, but they are thousands of dollars and require calibration really often.
    '''
    ,
    '''
    E. coli levels are measured by analyzing bacterial growth in laboratory analyses.
    This is commonly done by the membrane filter procedure, although color test kits have also been EPA-approved.
    Care must be taken when collecting water samples because all of the sampling containers must be sterile.
    '''
    ,
    '''
    The EPA-approved method for measuring total orthophosphate is known as the ascorbic acid method.
    Briefly, a reagent (either liquid or powder) containing ascorbic acid and ammonium molybdate
    reacts with orthophosphate in the sample to form a blue compound.
    '''
    ,
    '''
    Water temperature is measured in degrees with a digital or analog thermometer.
    Make sure the thermometer is submerged at least 10 cm from the surface of the water.
    Hold under the water for 5 minutes. You will know it is ready when the temperature has remained
    the same for at least 30 seconds.
    '''
    ,
    '''
    pH is measured on a logarithmic scale from 0-14, with 7 indicating neutral water.
    There are many tools for measuring pH, from expensive digital probes to easy to use test strips.
    We use test strips for pH. We have compared 15 types of test strips, and those made by Taylor have been shown to be the most accurate.
    For those looking for more accuracy, inexpensive pen-style meters have proven to be very accurate,
    but they need to be calibrated at least once a week. We have tried this one and it works well
    (however, you need to be careful not to dunk it too far in the water).
